# 📈 Time Series Stock Forecasting Project

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices using four different models:

* ARIMA
* SARIMA
* Prophet (by Meta)
* LSTM (Deep Learning)

Each model is evaluated using various error metrics, and an interactive dashboard is built using Streamlit.

---

## 📄 Objective

To compare traditional and machine learning time series forecasting models in terms of:

* Forecasting accuracy
* Interpretability
* Performance on recent stock price data

---

## 📊 Models Used

1. **ARIMA** – Classic time series model for trend
2. **SARIMA** – ARIMA with seasonal support
3. **Prophet** – Advanced trend/seasonality modeling
4. **LSTM** – Neural network for sequential prediction

---

## 🔢 Evaluation Metrics

Models are compared using the last 30 days of actual stock price data.

* **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
* **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
* **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
* **R² Score** (Explained Variance)
* **SMAPE** (Symmetric MAPE)
* **MSLE** (Mean Squared Log Error)
* **Residual Plots** & **Ljung-Box Test**

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

* LSTM generally gave the **best accuracy** but requires more compute.
* Prophet offered a good **balance of performance and interpretability**.
* SARIMA/ARIMA worked well but struggled with volatile movements.

## 📅 Tools & Libraries

* Python 3.x
* Streamlit
* pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn, statsmodels, yfinance
* Prophet (Meta)
* TensorFlow/Keras
